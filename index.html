                    I am an undergraduate student of Ateneo De Manila University (ADMU), currently studying and undertaking the
                    <a href="https://www.ateneo.edu/sose/discs/academics/undergraduate">Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Bachelor of Science in Digital Game Design and Development</a> degree program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have learnt both foundational topics about Computer Science (Computer Architecture and Operating Systems, Data Structures and Information Management), including subjects regarding software/web development such as UX Design, SQL, HTML, Django and Basic JavaScript
                    which allowed me to code and build projects, either as a solo developer or as member of a development team. In terms of Game Development, This semester I just learned fundemental concepts for Unity, Godot and OpenGL.
                    These projects were made to 1.) solve problems of accredited clients, 2.) get used to Computer Science and Game Design and Development Concepts, 3.) and/or for personal learning.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Now, I am looking for more chances to apply the skills and knowledge I have gathered in order to gain more experience,
                    giving me more opportunities for my career, as well as giving me more opportunities to help others with their projects. 
                </p>
